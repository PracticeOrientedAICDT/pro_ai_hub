Despite the hugeefforts put into building LLM-based autonomous agents, the architecture designof the agents has not yet been systematically explored. Also, while there aresignificant benefits of using autonomous agents for planning and execution,there are serious considerations regarding responsible AI related softwarequality attributes, such as security and accountability. Therefore, this paperpresents a pattern-oriented reference architecture that serves as architecturedesign guidelines and enables responsible-AI-by-design when designing LLM-basedautonomous agents. We evaluate the completeness and utility of the proposedreference architecture by mapping it to the architecture of two real-worldagents."

    "text": "Tldr\nArtificial intelligence has made significant progress in the Close Worldproblem, being able to accurately recognize old knowledge through training andclassification. However, AI faces significant challenges in the Open Worldproblem, as it involves a new and unknown exploration journey. AI is notinherently proactive in exploration, and its challenge lies in not knowing howto approach and adapt to the unknown world. How do humans acquire knowledge ofthe unknown world. Humans identify new knowledge through intrinsic cognition.In the process of recognizing new colors, the cognitive cues are different fromknown color features and involve hue, saturation, brightness, and othercharacteristics. When AI encounters objects with different features in the newworld, it faces another challenge: where are the distinguishing featuresbetween influential features of new and old objects? AI often mistakes a newworld’s brown bear for a known dog because it has not learned the differencesin feature distributions between knowledge systems. This is because things inthe new and old worlds have different units and dimensions for their features.This paper proposes an open-world model and elemental feature system thatfocuses on fundamentally recognizing the distribution differences in objectivefeatures between the new and old worlds. The quantum tunneling effect oflearning ability in the new and old worlds is realized through the tractiveforce of meta-characteristic. The outstanding performance of the model systemin learning new knowledge (using pedestrian re-identification datasets as anexample) demonstrates that AI has acquired the ability to recognize the newworld with an accuracy of \\(96.71\\%\\) at most and has gained the capability toexplore new knowledge, similar to humans."

However, LLM-based agents face limitations in real-time dynamicenvironments due to their lack of specialization in solving specific targetproblems. Moreover, the deployment of such LLM-based agents is both costly andtime-consuming in practical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novelframework that addresses these challenges by training a smaller scalespecialized student agent using instructions from an LLM-based teacher agent.By leveraging guided actions provided by the teachers, the prior knowledge ofthe LLM is distilled into the local student model. Consequently, the studentagent can be trained with significantly less data. Furthermore, subsequenttraining with environment feedback empowers the student agents to surpass thecapabilities of their teachers. We conducted experiments on three challengingMiniGrid environments to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework. Theresults demonstrate that our approach enhances sample efficiency and achievessuperior performance compared to baseline methods."

    "text": "Tldr\nThis paper investigates Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR), apromising method that uses information from multiple domains (more than three)to generate accurate and diverse recommendations, and takes into account thesequential nature of user interactions. The effectiveness of these systemsoften depends on the complex interplay among the multiple domains. In thisdynamic landscape, the problem of negative transfer arises, where heterogeneousknowledge between dissimilar domains leads to performance degradation due todifferences in user preferences across these domains. As a remedy, we propose anew CDSR framework that addresses the problem of negative transfer by assessingthe extent of negative transfer from one domain to another and adaptivelyassigning low weight values to the corresponding prediction losses. To thisend, the amount of negative transfer is estimated by measuring the marginalcontribution of each domain to model performance based on a cooperative gametheory. In addition, a hierarchical contrastive learning approach thatincorporates information from the sequence of coarse-level categories into thatof fine-level categories (e.g., item level) when implementing contrastivelearning was developed to mitigate negative transfer. Despite the potentiallylow relevance between domains at the fine-level, there may be higher relevanceat the category level due to its generalised and broader preferences. We showthat our model is superior to prior works in terms of model performance on tworeal-world datasets across ten different domains."

Probabilistic circuitsguarantee inference that is polynomial in the size of the circuit. In thispaper, we improve the explainability of probabilistic circuits by computing acomprehensible, readable logical theory that covers the high-density regionsgenerated by a PC. To achieve this, pruning approaches based on generativesignificance are used in a new method called PUTPUT (Probabilistic circuitUnderstanding Through Pruning Underlying logical Theories). The method isapplied to a real world use case where music playlists are automaticallygenerated and expressed as readable (database) queries. Evaluation shows thatthis approach can effectively produce a comprehensible logical theory thatdescribes the high-density regions of a PC and outperforms state of the artmethods when exploring the performance-comprehensibility trade-off."

Chain-of-thought (CoT), as apopular prompt engineering technique, prompted LLMs using in-context exampleswith reasoning steps. In current studies, the few-shot examples of CoT aregenerally handcrafted by humans. However, how the text style of in-contextexamples influence the outputs of LLMs still remains under-explored. This paperpresents a novel and effective approach, named , to improvethe reasoning capability of LLMs by aligning the in-context examples with thenative style of LLMs. ``Native’’ refers to the inherent characteristic style ofLLMs which can be probed by original zero-shot scenarios. AlignCoT isorthogonal to other prompt engineering methods, making it easy to combine withstate-of-the-art techniques to further improve the LLMs’ performance. Weconduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on several benchmarks. Theempirical results demonstrate that our AlignCoTsignificantly improvesperformance over the carefully handcrafted in-context examples. For instance,with GPT-3.5-turbo, we observed a +2.5% improvement on GSM8K. Furthermore, ourAlignCoT consistently improve the performance when combined with otherstate-of-the-art prompt engineering methods. The source code and dataset willbe available at."

In this context, Entrepreneurial Finance is a particularly fertileground for future Artificial Intelligence proliferation. To support the latter,the study provides a bibliometric review of Artificial Intelligenceapplications in (1) entrepreneurial finance literature, and (2) corporatefinance literature with implications for Entrepreneurship. Rigorous search andscreening procedures of the scientific database Web of Science Core Collectionresulted in the identification of 1890 relevant journal articles subjected toanalysis. The bibliometric analysis gives a rich insight into the knowledgefield’s conceptual, intellectual, and social structure, indicating nascent andunderdeveloped research directions. As far as we were able to identify, this isthe first study to map and bibliometrically analyze the academic fieldconcerning the relationship between Artificial Intelligence, Entrepreneurship,and Finance, and the first review that deals with Artificial Intelligencemethods in Entrepreneurship. According to the results, Artificial NeuralNetwork, Deep Neural Network and Support Vector Machine are highly representedin almost all identified topic niches. At the same time, applying TopicModeling, Fuzzy Neural Network and Growing Hierarchical Self-organizing Map isquite rare. As an element of the research, and before final remarks, thearticle deals as well with a discussion of certain gaps in the relationshipbetween Computer Science and Economics. These gaps do represent problems in theapplication of Artificial Intelligence in Economic Science. As a way to atleast in part remedy this situation, the foundational paradigm and the bespokedemonstration of the Monte Carlo randomized algorithm are presented."

Early detection is the best way toreduce the impact of the disease. Researchers have developed many techniques todetect breast cancer, including the use of histopathology images in CADsystems. This research proposes a technique that combine already fully trainedmodel using adaptive average ensemble, this is different from the literaturewhich uses average ensemble before training and the average ensemble is trainedsimultaneously. Our approach is different because it used adaptive averageensemble after training which has increased the performance of evaluationmetrics. It averages the outputs of every trained model, and every model willhave weight according to its accuracy. The accuracy in the adaptive weightedensemble model has achieved 98% where the accuracy has increased by 1 percentwhich is better than the best participating model in the ensemble which was97%. Also, it decreased the numbers of false positive and false negative andenhanced the performance metrics."

    "text": "Tldr\nThe field of Optimal Control under Partial Differential Equations (PDE)constraints is rapidly changing under the influence of Deep Learning and theaccompanying automatic differentiation libraries. Novel techniques likePhysics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Differentiable Programming (DP)are to be contrasted with established numerical schemes like Direct-AdjointLooping (DAL). We present a comprehensive comparison of DAL, PINN, and DP usinga general-purpose mesh-free differentiable PDE solver based on Radial BasisFunctions. Under Laplace and Navier-Stokes equations, we found DP to beextremely effective as it produces the most accurate gradients; thriving evenwhen DAL fails and PINNs struggle. Additionally, we provide a detailedbenchmark highlighting the limited conditions under which any of those methodscan be efficiently used. Our work provides a guide to Optimal Controlpractitioners and connects them further to the Deep Learning community."

    "text": "Tldr\nThe exploration of multimodal language models integrates multiple data types,such as images, text, language, audio, and other heterogeneity. While thelatest large language models excel in text-based tasks, they often struggle tounderstand and process other data types. Multimodal models address thislimitation by combining various modalities, enabling a more comprehensiveunderstanding of diverse data. This paper begins by defining the concept ofmultimodal and examining the historical development of multimodal algorithms.Furthermore, we introduce a range of multimodal products, focusing on theefforts of major technology companies. A practical guide is provided, offeringinsights into the technical aspects of multimodal models. Moreover, we presenta compilation of the latest algorithms and commonly used datasets, providingresearchers with valuable resources for experimentation and evaluation. Lastly,we explore the applications of multimodal models and discuss the challengesassociated with their development. By addressing these aspects, this paper aimsto facilitate a deeper understanding of multimodal models and their potentialin various domains."

However, such investigation has been comparativelyunderexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic examination of thecalibration of aligned language models throughout the entire constructionprocess, including pretraining and alignment training. At each stage, weinvestigate how different training settings, such as parameter scales andtraining data, affect model calibration. To thoroughly assess modelcalibration, we evaluate models on three most concerned aspects: generation,factuality and understanding.
